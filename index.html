<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">
3D imaging is essential for studying many biological processes. In microscopy we often collect volumes using standard
focus to take a series of 2D images. For standard focus we avoid aberrations by matching the refractive index (RI) 
of the sample to the immersion of the objective, an awkward constraint for microscope users and designers. We can
also focus with remote refocus (RR) optics, but these are traditionally restricted to the immersion of the objective, 
leaving little flexibility in choosing the sample RI. Here we present a versatile approach to aberration-free 3D 
imaging, where an objective of any immersion can be combined with a sample of any RI. For example, we can look into 
a watery sample with a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective, and use RR optics to extend the focal range from ~6&mu;m to 
~151&mu;m. Avoiding liquid immersion is convenient for users and great for automated microscopy. Similarly, we can 
extend the range of a Nikon 40x1.30 oil objective from ~8&mu;m to ~65&mu;m in water, and enjoy a larger field of 
view and numerical aperture (NA) compared to the equivalent water immersion objective. We can apply this method to 
use different objectives on the same system, with immersion-free, maximum depth and maximum NA modalities. In 
addition, we present a dynamic zoom lens to enable fast RR tuning in the RI range 1.33-1.51, which maximizes 
performance for a diverse range of biological samples. By combining different objectives with dynamic RR optics 
we can make an 'any' immersion microscope with a boosted focal range.

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
Imaging samples in 3D with high spatial resolution is essential for studying many biological processes. In 
microscopy, we typically collect 2D images with an objective lens near the sample, and high spatial resolution 
is mostly achieved with high <a href="./appendix.html#na_and_resolution">numerical aperture</a> (NA). To get 3D
data we routinely take a series of 2D images at different depths, or focal planes, and use these images to construct 
a volume we can explore.
</p>
<p>
Here we discuss the mechanisms and limitations of two different focus methods we refer to as "standard focus" and 
"remote refocus" (RR). We then show how these methods can be combined to produce a microscope with a boosted focal 
range for any combination of immersion medium and sample refractive index (RI). The design options we explore here 
are readily applied to systems with existing RR optics, like single-objective light-sheet 
<a href="https://andrewgyork.github.io/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet/">(SOLS)</a> microscopes.
</p>

<h4 id="sf_intro">Standard focus</h4>
<p>
To change the focal plane on a typical widefield microscope we usually move the objective towards the sample, a 
method we refer to here as "standard focus". The maximum range of this operation is mechanically limited 
by the distance between the front of the objective and the image plane, usually called the working distance (WD). 
However, the range of standard focus may be dramatically reduced by the choice of sample RI, which is an awkward 
reality for microscope users and designers. To understand (and avoid) this effect we can consider the focusing 
process in more detail.
</p>
<p>
We can think of the space between the front of the objective and the image plane as the 'final elements' in the
lens design, where the shape and RI matter (especially at high NA). The shape is fixed by the image plane and the 
final solid surface of the objective (usually a glass lens). The RI is set by the intended <em>immersion</em> medium
for the objective, for example air, water or oil (and sometimes a coverslip). Deviating from the intended shape or 
RI can produce severe aberrations and blurry images.
</p>
<p>
When we use standard focus to image deeper into a sample, layers or 'slabs' of intended immersion (like air, water 
or oil) are effectively exchanged for slabs of sample. If we <em>match</em> the sample RI to the immersion, then 
this is a null operation and the objective will image as designed 
(<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1, 1/3</a>). However, if we have some RI <em>mismatch</em>, 
then the slab of sample (with unintended RI) will produce spherical aberration, and make the images 
blurry with enough depth (<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1, 2/3 and 3/3</a>)

<strong>So, for standard focus we must match the sample refractive index to the immersion to avoid 
aberrations</strong>:

 \[ n_i = n_s \tag{1} \]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_s\) are the immersion and sample RI respectively.

<figcaption>
<strong>Figure 1: Standard focus into a watery sample with water, air and oil immersion.</strong> 
This cartoon shows a watery 3D sample (like a cell in media) being imaged at different depths by a standard widefield 
microscope (objective and tube lens pair). The image is formed at the camera and relayed to the toy screen, which 
shows image planes at different depths in the sample as the objective moves up and down.
<strong>Animation 1/3</strong> shows a water immersion objective that is refractive index <em>matched</em> to the 
sample, giving good images at depth.
<strong>Animation 2/3</strong> shows an air objective that is refractive index <em>mismatched</em> to the sample and
therefore gives blurry imaging from depth induced spherical aberration.
<strong>Animation 3/3</strong> shows an oil immersion objective that (like animation 2/3) is also refractive index 
<em>mismatched</em> giving blurry images with depth.

<p>
Our need to refractive index match the sample to the immersion for 3D imaging is awkward. The RI of biological 
samples varies significantly, leaving microscope users and designers chasing around between different 
immersion options (with no flexible solution). Air immersion is the most convenient and is excellent for 
high-speed tiling, but it has the lowest NA and low depth penetration due to the large RI difference. Water 
immersion is usually a good RI match for live samples, but it requires regular hydration (from evaporation) and has 
the lowest NA of the liquid immersions. Oil immersion offers the highest NA, and is insensitive to coverslip 
thickness, but struggles with depth from the RI mismatch. A good compromise between NA and RI matching is silicone 
oil immersion, but this is still cumbersome in tiling applications.

As an alternative to standard focus, remote refocus (RR) optics

<p>
The main feature of an RR setup is the ability to adjust the focal plane without moving the primary objective or the 
sample, for example by moving one of the downstream objectives 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 1/3</a>). In contrast to standard focus, where the RI of 
the immersion and the sample must match, in RR we can exchange slabs of <em>different</em> RI between the sample 
and the remote volume. For example, it is common to use air immersion in the remote space with an aqueous sample. 
We avoid spherical aberration by setting the magnification between the sample and remote space \(M_{RR}\) to 
preserve angles:

\[ M_{RR} = \frac{n_s}{n_{RR}} \tag{2} \]

where \(n_{RR}\) is the immersion of the remote space.
</p>
<p>
It is traditional to <em>assume</em> that the sample RI matches the immersion, and to configure the RR optics for 
this RI. However, in the case where the sample RI and immersion are not matched, <strong>we should optimize the 
remote refocus for the refractive index of the sample, not the immersion of the objective.</strong>

<strong>Figure 2: Remote refocus into a watery sample with water, air and oil immersion.</strong> 
This cartoon shows a watery 3D sample (like a cell in media) being imaged at different depths by a remote refocus 
(RR) microscope (a widefield + 2 additional microscopes). The optics in the first 2 microscopes (widefield + tube 
lens objective pair) are configured to produce an aberration-free 3D copy of the sample in the remote space, which 
is then re-imaged by the 3rd microscope (objective tube and lens pair). 
<strong>Note: the RR optics are set for a watery sample, regardless of the immersion used by the primary objective.</strong> 
The final image is formed at the camera and relayed to the toy screen, which shows image planes at different depths 
in the sample as the objective in the 3rd microscope moves back and forth.
<strong>Animation 1/3</strong> shows a water immersion objective that is refractive index <em>matched</em> to the 
sample. In this configuration the standard focus and RR both have maximum range, although only the RR range is 
animated here (giving extra range over standard focus).
<strong>Animation 2/3</strong> shows an air objective that is refractive index <em>mismatched</em> to the sample,
greatly reducing the range of standard focus. However, the RR is still optimized for a watery sample, and so the 
remote range persists.
<strong>Deeper immersion-free microscopy</strong> is available in this configuration.
<strong>Animation 3/3</strong> shows an oil immersion objective that (like animation 2/3) is also refractive index 
<em>mismatched</em> (reducing the range of standard focus). However, like animation 2/3, the RR is still optimized 
for a watery sample and the range persists.

<h4 id="sf_and_rr_intro">Using standard focus and remote refocus together</h4>

<p>
In a typical RR microscope we would match the sample RI with the immersion for standard focus (equation 1), and we 
would configure the RR optics for the sample (equation 2), yielding maximum range for both focus methods. However, a 
key realization is that if the RI of the sample and immersion differ, then the range of standard focus will reduce, 
but the RR range persists. Conversely, if we match the sample RI with the immersion, but the RR is optimized for a 
different RI, then the RR range will reduce and the standard focus range will persist.
<strong>So we can choose to optimize standard focus and remote refocus for different refractive indices, which 
reveals new design options.</strong>.
</p>
<p>
It is counter intuitive to deviate from the 'usual' system design, where we match the immersion and RR optics for 
the same RI. However, there are some compelling options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deeper immersion-free microscopy:</strong> we can combine a high NA air objective (with very limited standard 
focus range in liquids) with a remote refocus optimized for liquid 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 2/3</a>). Avoiding liquid immersion is very convenient for 
users and great for automated microscopy, like time-lapse imaging or high-speed tiling.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deeper maximum NA microscopy:</strong> we can combine a high NA oil objective (with reduced standard focus 
range in watery samples) with a remote refocus optimized for water 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 3/3</a>). Oil immersion is coverslip insensitive and offers 
the maximum NA for live biological samples, exceeding that of high quality water immersion objectives.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Any sample refractive index microscopy:</strong> by decoupling the choice of immersion from how we configure
the RR, we can set the RR optics (via equation 2) to image deeper into any sample. For example, we can 
continuously tune the RR for any sample RI in the range 1.33-1.51 and access aberration-free volumes that have 
traditionally been unavailable (<a href="#fig_zoom_optics" target="_self">Figure 5</a>).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Any immersion microscopy:</strong> by combing different objectives with tunable RR optics we can get
aberration-free volumes with any immersion and any sample RI on the same microscope. So we can have single 
instrument with with immersion-free, maximum depth and maximum NA modalities.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We gear the rest of this article towards exploring new design options for high NA 3D microscopy, although we note 
that these findings are not limited to this regime, and compelling applications may be found with lower NA and larger 
field of view systems. In the <a href="#results" target="_self">results</a> section we compare standard focus to RR 
for some attractive choices of primary objective, and show a concrete example of tunable RR optics. In the 
<a href="#data" target="_self">data</a> section we demonstrate the power of the technique by imaging deep into a 
watery sample with a high NA air objective (that would normally give very blurry images). For the 
<a href="#discussion" target="_self">discussion</a> section we consider an attractive microscope design and review
the main benefits of the technology.
</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>
To evaluate the deeper imaging potential of a remote refocus microscope 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2</a>) compared to a widefield setup 
(<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1</a>), we take a practical approach and model how a series of 
commercially available objectives compare in each configuration. For the sake of simplicity, we limit our search to a
<a href="./appendix.html#objective_selection">collection of Nikon objectives</a> that are compatible with
<a href="https://andrewgyork.github.io/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet/">SOLS</a>
microscope design (a compelling use case for RR optics). We can therefore constrain the 
<a href="./appendix.html#na_and_resolution">numerical aperture</a>, 
<a href="./appendix.html#f_fov_and_pixels">focal length</a> and immersion medium for a given setup, although we 
point out that these ideas can be applied to other manufacturers, and at lower NA. We can then calculate the 
<a href="./appendix.html#standard_focus_range">standard focus</a> and 
<a href="./appendix.html#remote_refocus_range">remote refocus</a> ranges as a function of the sample refractive index 
\( n_s \) over the biological range:
\[ 1.33 \leq n_s \leq 1.51 \tag{3} \]
</p>

<h4 id="sf_result">Standard focus range</h4>
<p>
In <a href="#fig_sf_range" target="_self">Figure 3</a> we compare the accessible imaging range of different 
objectives in a widefield microscope. In particular we plot the diffraction limited depth of standard focus 
as a function of the sample RI according to <a href="./appendix.html#standard_focus_range">equation a8</a>. The 
interactive figure can be toggled between linear and log scales for the highest NA objectives, and those with the 
'<a href="./appendix.html#f_fov_and_pixels">most pixels</a>' (\( N_{px} \)). For example, in the high NA category, the 
100x1.35 silicone oil objective offers the best compromise for varying sample types, with a minimum range of 10&mu;m 
for any RI. However, if the samples are mostly aqueous, then the 60x1.27 water lens has a much larger range 
(limited by the working distance at 180&mu;m). The 40x0.95 air objective is perhaps the worst option for depth, 
offering only ~6&mu;m for any liquid sample (visible on the log scale). The 100x1.45 oil may be the least attractive 
option for live biology, with the inconvenience of liquid immersion and the lowest range in watery samples (forcing 
the 3&mu;m lower bound). Similar trends can be seen in the most pixels category.

objectives are still limited to a particular immersion, but we can (in principle) tune the RR optics continuously 
across the range of the sample RI (shown here). All of the configurations now benefit from the extra range provided 
by the RR. In particular, in the high NA category the lower bound on the 100x1.45 oil lens has now jumped from 
3&mu;m to 35&mu;m, converting it into an attractive option for many applications. In practice, this delivers deeper 
imaging at <strong>maximum NA</strong> for any sample RI under 1.45. Most apparent in the high NA category is the 
large increase in depth now available to the 40x0.95 air objective, offering deeper 
<strong>immersion-free</strong> imaging up to 151&mu;m!

In the introduction, we discuss how the RR magnification should be set according to equation 2, and that we should 
optimize for the sample RI (not the immersion). Previously, we used static optical configurations to set the RR 
magnification for a particular immersion

with the hope that the sample would not deviate much from this RI. Here we present a dynamic zoom lens to enable 
fast RR tuning in the refractive index range 1.33-1.51, which maximizes performance for a diverse range of 
biological samples (<a href="#fig_zoom_optics" target="_self">Figure 5</a>). Our design uses inexpensive stock 
parts, maintains constant track length and telecentricity, and is diffraction limited across the visible spectrum 
and standard sCMOS field of view (<a href="./appendix.html#zoom_lens">see appendix for details</a>). Specifically 
this module is intended to replace the tube lens in the second microscope of an RR system, and provides a concrete 
design to enable the focal ranges shown in <a href="#fig_sf_and_rr_range" target="_self">Figure 4</a>.

This animation shows an example of a zoom lens that can replace a static tube lens in a remote refocus microscope. In 
this version the focal length varies continuously as the elements are moved, allowing the magnification of the RR to 
be tuned across the biological refractive index range 1.33-1.51. The lens uses inexpensive stock parts, maintains 
constant track length and telecentricity, and is diffraction limited across the visible spectrum and standard sCMOS 
field of view (<a href="./appendix.html#zoom_lens">see appendix for details</a>).

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>
To demonstrate the power of the 'any immersion' concept we built a prototype large field of view 
<a href="https://andrewgyork.github.io/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet/">SOLS</a> microscope with (static) 
RR optics tuned for water 
(<a href="./appendix.html#large_fov_sols_current">see here for instrument details</a>). We then used this 
platform to directly <strong>compare a Nikon 40x1.15 water objective against a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective imaging
deep into a watery sample</strong> 
(<a href="https://github.com/amsikking/fluorescent_beads_in_agarose">fluorescent beads in agarose</a>).
We picked this example since the RI mismatch between air and water is very high, and so the benefit of the RR range
compared to the standard focus range is particularly pronounced.
</p>

<h4 id="water_objective_data">Water objective</h4>
<p>
We use the 40x1.15 water objective as the 'benchmark' for a typical optical configuration, where the immersion 
and sample have the same RI. In this mode the volumetric point spread function (PSF) is insensitive to standard 
focus, so we can move the primary objective up and down to access different depths 
(<a href="#fig_water_objective_psf_vs_focus" target="_self">Figure 6</a>). The main benefits of this setup are an
increased NA and total focus range (standard + RR), in exchange for the inconvenience of the water 
immersion.
</p>

<figure id="fig_water_objective_psf_vs_focus">

<strong>Figure 6: PSF vs standard focus for a 40x1.15 water objective.</strong>
This animation shows the volumetric point spread function of a Nikon 40x1.15 water immersion objective as a 
function of standard focus (z). The fluorescent beads were prepared in a watery gel according to 
<a href="https://github.com/amsikking/fluorescent_beads_in_agarose">this protocol</a>. Since the sample
RI <em>matches</em> the water immersion the PSF is insensitive to standard focus, allowing an increased range of 
focus (standard + remote) when using the microscope in this modality. <strong>Note:</strong> each frame of the 
animation shows the max projections of the entire volume (~330x355x125)&mu;m<sup>3</sup> in traditional XY, XZ 
and YZ coordinates.

<p></p>

<h4 id="air_objective_data">Air objective</h4>
<p>
<strong>We can now <em>swap</em> the 40x1.15 water objective for the 40x0.95 air objective on the same microscope 
and get good volumetric PSF deep into the watery gel!</strong> Normally the depth of standard focus is limited to 
about ~6&mu;m 
(<a href="#fig_sf_range" target="_self">Figure 3</a>), but here we can clearly image &gt; 50&mu;m 
(<a href="#fig_air_objective_psf_vs_focus" target="_self">Figure 7</a>). This mode has the benefit of being 
immersion-free, with the drawback of slightly lower NA and a greatly reduced standard focus range.
</p>

<strong>Figure 7: PSF vs standard focus for a 40x0.95 air objective.</strong>
This animation shows the volumetric point spread function of a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective as a 
function of standard focus. The fluorescent beads were prepared in a watery gel according to 
<a href="https://github.com/amsikking/fluorescent_beads_in_agarose">this protocol</a>. Since the sample
RI strongly <em>mismatches</em> the air immersion the PSF is highly sensitive to standard focus. However, as 
predicted by the results section, there is a ~6&mu;m range over which the remote refocus volume is good, allowing 
deeper immersion-free imaging when using the microscope in this modality (i.e. for convenience or high speed tiling
etc). <strong>Note:</strong> each frame of the animation shows the max projections of the entire volume 
(~330x355x125)&mu;m<sup>3</sup> in traditional XY, XZ and YZ coordinates.

<h4 id="psf_data">Point spread function</h4>
<p>
If we 'park' the standard focus in a good place for both the water and air objectives (i.e. at 'zero' depth where
the focal plane is just above the coverslip) then we can compare the PSF in both configurations over the volume
(~330x195x65&mu;m<sup>3</sup>). For the <strong>water objective PSF</strong> we found full width half max (FWHM) 
values in the range <strong>(425-582)nm radially and (1.38&pm;0.11)&mu;m axially</strong> 
<a href="figures/data/water_objective/beads">(2577 beads used for statistics)</a>. For the 
<strong>air objective PSF</strong> we found FWHM values in the range <strong>(422-550)nm radially and 
(2.08&pm;0.07)&mu;m axially</strong> 
<a href="figures/data/air_objective/beads">(2716 beads)</a>. As expected the water objective has notably improved 
axial PSF due to the higher NA. The higher NA should also show in a reduced radial PSF but the 
<a href="./appendix.html#large_fov_sols_current">current instrument prototype</a> was originally optimized for 
the air objective so there is some vignetting at objective 2 and the pixel size (~220nm) is too large 
(<a href="./appendix.html#large_fov_sols_improved">addressed here with an improved design</a>). Overall 
these PSF results are in line with similar microscopes like DaXi which gave (380-480)nm radial and 
(1.86&pm;0.17)&mu;m axial

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>
In contrast to conventional microscopy, we have shown that we can use RR optics to collect aberration-free 3D 
volumes for any combination of immersion and sample RI. The method is quite general, and applies to high and low NA 
systems with many configuration options. To highlight some of the advantages of this new design space, we target 
the discussion towards high NA systems for <em>watery samples</em> that are most relevant to 3D time-lapse imaging 
(like living cells and organisms).
</p>
<p>
If we restrict the microscope to a widefield, then we can see that the 60x1.27 water objective has the highest 
diffraction limited depth for any sample RI under ~1.36 (<a href="#fig_sf_range" target="_self">Figure 3</a>). In 
this regime the other objectives (air, silicone and oil) should only be considered for very shallow 3D samples 
(&lt; 10&mu;m) or speciality situations where the lack of immersion or marginal increase in NA are required 
(like high-speed 2D tiling or TIRF microscopy). With a 333&mu;m field of view, a theoretical resolving power of 
~250nm and ~2600 pixels, the 60x water objective is a good match for current sCMOS cameras 
(<a href="./appendix.html#table_highest_na">specifications from table</a>). Although water objectives are sensitive 
to coverslip tilt, thickness and require regular hydration, the 60x1.27 offers the best 3D imaging performance for
watery samples in the high NA category.
</p>
<p>
If we now consider a remote refocus microscope (like a 
<a href="https://andrewgyork.github.io/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet/">SOLS</a> system), we can see a
new series of configurations that significantly outcompete widefield in terms of volumetric range and NA 
(<a href="#fig_rr_range" target="_self">Figure 4</a>).
For example, we can combine an RR optimized for water with multiple objectives, like a 40x1.15 
water objective for <strong>maximum depth</strong> (600&mu;m for MRD77410), a 40x0.95 air objective for 
<strong>immersion-free</strong> speed and convenience, and a 40x1.30 oil objective for <strong>maximum NA</strong>. 
Because these lenses have the same focal length they are <em>interchangeable</em> on the same system, and at 40x 
magnification, they offer larger fields of view (500&mu;m) and pixel counts (&gt; 2927) than the 60x1.27 water 
objective (the leading widefield option). 
</p>
<p>
We propose that remote refocus optics should always be configured for the sample RI, and not the immersion of the 
objective. We acknowledge that for the same or similar samples this may be achieved with static 
optical configurations. However, we present a dynamic zoom lens to quickly tune the RR optics for the biological 
refractive index range 1.33-1.51, which minimizes aberrations for a diverse range of samples. Tuning the RR also 
avoids the axial 'stretching' (\(n_i \gt n_s\)) and 'squashing' (\(n_i \lt n_s\)) distortions from using standard 
focus with mismatched immersion

title="Tutorial: avoiding and correcting sample-induced spherical aberration artifacts in 3D fluorescence microscopy; 
E.E. Diel, J.W. Lichtman and D.S. Richardson; (2020)">Diel 2020</a>]. Furthermore, dynamic RR optics have the 
<em>additional benefit</em> of keeping excitation light aligned with the remote volume at different sample RI 
(as is needed for example in SOLS microscopes). <strong>We propose that a dynamic magnification compensator is the 
prefered way to build a remote refocus microscope when imaging samples of varied refractive index.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We find the <strong>immersion-free</strong> configurations particularly attractive for high throughput screening 
applications

(2016)">Maioli 2016</a>], 
where the benefit of high-speed tiling can greatly outweigh the slightly lower NA of an of air objective 
compared to liquid immersion options. In this regime, the increase in depth of a remote refocus microscope over a 
widefield is substantial, for example 151&mu;m vs 6&mu;m for the 40x0.95 air objective. We also find the thermal 
isolation from the 'air gap' appealing, avoiding the need to heat the objective for incubated samples. In addition,
the stronger reflections from the air to coverlsip boundary could be beneficial for hardware autofocus systems.
</p>
<p> 
We see the coverslip insensitive oil immersion options with <strong>maximum NA</strong> as a great option for 3D 
super resolution

that benefit from the highest angular collection at the primary objective. For example, the 40x1.30 oil objective from the
<a href="./appendix.html#table_most_pixels">'most pixels' category</a> can now be considered near maximum NA for 
water samples up to a diffraction limited depth of 65&mu;m, making it an impressive option for many applications.
<p>

<p>
Given the 'mix and match' nature of the design space and the strong dependency on sample RI, we encourage builders to 
absorb the ideas presented here, run their own calculations, and then build the best system for their application.
<strong>This is a 'game changer' from the perspective of microscope users and designers, since we can now access 
aberration-free volumes for any combination of immersion or sample refractive index.</strong>
