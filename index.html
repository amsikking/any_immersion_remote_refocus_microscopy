<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">
We typically achieve aberration-free 3D imaging in a widefield microscope by matching the immersion of the primary
objective to the refractive index (RI) of the sample. In a remote refocus (RR) microscope we get high quality volumes
by tuning the downstream optics to the RI of sample. Ideally we would optimize the widefield and RR optics for the 
same sample, yielding the maximum diffraction limited range for both focus methods. However, we make the argument 
that which RI standard focus and RR are optimized for is an independent choice, which counterintuitively leads to 
some interesting design options. We discover a deeper immersion-free microscopy regime by using an air objective 
with a RR optimized for liquid. For example we can extend the range of a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective from 6&mu;m to 
151&mu;m in water (widefield vs RR). Avoiding liquid immersion can be very convenient for users 
and great for automated microscopy, like high-throughput screening. We also find deeper maximum numerical aperture 
(NA) microscopy for live biology by using a high NA oil objective with RR optics tuned for watery samples. For 
example we can extend the range of a Nikon 40x1.30 oil objective from 8&mu;m to 65&mu;m in water, and enjoy a field 
of view and NA that exceeds the equivalent water immersion objective. Furthermore we can now 
build multi-immersion systems on the same platform that benefit from different regimes. For example a microscope with 
40x0.95 air objective for speed and convenience, a 40x1.15 water objective for maximum depth and a 40x1.30 oil 
objective for maximum NA. The design ideas we explore here are of particular relevance to systems with existing 
RR optics, like single-objective light-sheet (SOLS) microscopes.

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
Choosing an objective lens is one of the most important considerations when using a visible light microscope. For
example an objective's <a href="./appendix.html#na_and_resolution">numerical aperture</a> (NA) and 
<a href="./appendix.html#f_fov_and_pixels">field of view</a> (FOV) will determine the maximum available resolution 
and object size in the image. When we image 3D semi-transparent biological samples at high NA it is necessary to 
adjust the focal plane to access the volumetric information. For example we often move the objective towards the 
object to get a series of 2D images at different depths, a method we refer to as "standard focus". The maximum 
imaging depth of a typical widefield microscope is therefore ultimately limited by the working distance (WD) of the 
objective.
</p>
<p>
The positive working distance we need for standard focusing contains the 'final elements' in the objective lens
design, where the shape and refractive index (RI) matter. Fortunately the shape is fixed by the image plane and the 
final solid surface of the objective (usually a glass lens). However, the RI of this space can vary, i.e the 
<em>immersion</em> medium (and sometimes a coverslip). When we use standard focus 'slabs' of intended immersion 
(like air, water or oil) are effectively exchanged for slabs of sample. If the sample RI matches the immersion RI 
then this is a null operation and the objective will image as designed 
(<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1, 1/3</a>). However, if there is a refractive index 
<em>mismatch</em> then the slab of sample (with unintended RI) will produce spherical aberration at finite NA, making 
the images blurry with enough depth (<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1, 2/3 and 3/3</a>)

<strong>Figure 1: Standard focus into a watery sample with water, air and oil immersion.</strong> 
This cartoon shows a watery 3D sample (like a cell in a multiwell plate) being imaged at different depths by a 
standard widefield microscope (objective tube lens pair). The image is formed at the camera and relayed to the 
toy screen, which shows image planes at different depths in the sample as the objective moves up and down.
<strong>Animation 1/3</strong> shows a water immersion objective that is refractive index <em>matched</em> to the 
sample, giving good images at depth.
<strong>Animation 2/3</strong> shows an air objective that is refractive index <em>mismatched</em> to the sample and
therefore gives blurry imaging from depth induced spherical aberration.
<strong>Animation 3/3</strong> shows an oil immersion objective that (like animation 2/3) is also refractive index 
<em>mismatched</em> giving blurry images with depth.
 </figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>
Our need to refractive index <em>match</em> the immersion to the sample for 3D imaging is awkward. The RI of 
biological samples varies significantly, leaving microscope users (and lens designers) chasing around between 
different immersion options. Air immersion is the most convenient and is excellent for high-speed tiling, but has the 
lowest NA and low depth penetration due to the large RI difference. Water immersion is usually a good RI match for 
live samples but requires regular hydration (from evaporation) and has the lowest NA of the liquid immersions. Oil 
immersion offers the highest NA and is insensitive to coverslip thickness but struggles with depth from the RI 
mismatch. A good compromise between NA and RI matching is silicone oil immersion, but this is still cumbersome in 
tiling applications.

. The main feature of an RR setup is
our ability to adjust the focal plane without moving the primary objective or the sample, for example by moving one
of the downstream objectives (<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 1/3</a>). In a remote refocus
we can exchange slabs of <em>different</em> refractive index between the sample and the remote volume. For example 
it is common to use air immersion in the remote space with an aqueous sample. We avoid spherical aberration by 
'tuning' the magnification between the sample and remote space to preserve angles (as detailed in 
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" 
title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; E.J. Botcherby, R. Juškaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson;
 Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">Botcherby 2007</a>). 
 <strong>So we should always optimize the remote refocus for the sample, not the immersion.</strong>

<figcaption>
<strong>Figure 2: Remote refocus into a watery sample with water, air and oil immersion.</strong> 
This cartoon shows a watery 3D sample (like a cell in a multiwell plate) being imaged at different depths by a remote
refocus microscope (a widefield + 2 additional microscopes). The optics in the first 2 microscopes (widefield + tube 
lens objective pair) are configured to produce an aberration-free 3D copy of the sample in the remote space, which is 
then re-imaged by the 3rd (objective tube lens pair). 
<strong>Note: the remote refocus optics are 'tuned' for a watery sample, regardless of the immersion 
used by the primary objective.</strong> 
The final image is formed at the camera and relayed to the toy screen, which shows image planes at different depths 
in the sample (as the objective in the 3rd microscope moves back and forth).
<strong>Animation 1/3</strong> shows a water immersion objective that is refractive index <em>matched</em> to the 
sample. In this configuration the standard focus and remote focus both have maximum range, although only the remote
focus range is animated here (giving extra range).
<strong>Animation 2/3</strong> shows an air objective that is refractive index <em>mismatched</em> to the sample,
greatly reducing the range of standard focus. However the remote refocus is still optimized for a watery sample, and
so the remote range persists.
<strong>Deeper immersion-free microscopy</strong> is available in this configuration.
<strong>Animation 3/3</strong> shows an oil immersion objective that (like animation 2/3) is also refractive index 
<em>mismatched</em> (reducing the range of standard focus). However (just like animation 2/3) the remote refocus is 
still optimized for a watery sample and the range persists.
<strong>Deeper maximum NA microscopy</strong> is available in this configuration.
 </figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>
In a perfect imaging system we would match the sample and immersion RI, and we would correct the RR magnification for 
the sample, yielding maximum range for both standard focus and remote refocus. If however, the RI of the sample 
and immersion differ, then the range of standard focusing will reduce, but the remote refocus range persists. 
Conversely, if we match the sample and immersion RI, but the remote refocus is optimized for a different RI, 
then the RR range will reduce and the standard focus range will persist. <strong>So which refractive index we optimize
for in standard focus and remote refocus is an independent choice</strong>.
</p>
<p>
It is counter intuitive to deviate from the 'ideal' system design, where we optimize the immersion and remote refocus 
for the same sample RI. However, upon closer inspection there are some interesting 
options:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deeper immersion-free microscopy:</strong> we can combine a high NA air objective (with very limited standard 
focus range in liquids) with a remote refocus optimized for liquid 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 2/3</a>). Avoiding liquid immersion is very convenient for 
users and great for automated microscopy, like time-lapse imaging or high-speed tiling.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deeper maximum NA microscopy:</strong> we can combine a high NA oil objective (with reduced standard focus 
range in watery samples) with a remote refocus optimized for water 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2, 3/3</a>). Oil immersion is coverslip insensitive and offers 
the maximum NA for live biological samples, exceeding that of high quality water immersion objectives.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We gear the rest of this article towards <em>how</em> to choose an objective lens in combination with RR optics, 
particularly in the context of high NA microscopy (like 
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3244420" 
title="High NA single-objective light-sheet; 
A. Millett-Sikking, K.M. Dean, R. Fiolka, A. Fardad, L. Whitehead and A.G. York; (2019)">SOLS microscopes</a>)
, and the regimes of deeper immersion-free and maximum NA imaging.
</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>
To evaluate the deeper imaging potential of a remote refocus microscope 
(<a href="#fig_rr_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 2</a>) compared to a widefield setup 
(<a href="#fig_sf_water_air_oil" target="_self">Figure 1</a>) we take a practical approach, and model how a series of 
commercially available objectives compare in each configuration. For the sake of simplicity we limit our search to a
<a href="./appendix.html#objective_selection">collection of Nikon objectives</a> that are compatible with SOLS 
microscope design (a compelling use case for RR optics). We can therefore constrain the 
<a href="./appendix.html#na_and_resolution">numerical aperture</a>, 
<a href="./appendix.html#f_fov_and_pixels">focal length</a> and immersion medium for a given setup, although we 
point out that these ideas can be applied to other manufacturers, and at lower NA. We can then calculate the 
<a href="./appendix.html#standard_focus_range">standard focus</a> and 
<a href="./appendix.html#remote_refocus_range">remote refocus</a> ranges as a function of the sample refractive index 
\( n_s \) over the biological range:
\[ 1.33 \leq n_s \leq 1.51 \tag{1} \]
</p>
<p>
In <a href="#fig_sf_range" target="_self">Figure 3</a> we show how the diffraction limited depth of standard focus on
a widefield microscope varies as a function of the sample RI 
<a href="./appendix.html#standard_focus_range">(equation a8)</a>. The interactive figure can be toggled between 
linear and log scales for the highest NA objectives from Nikon, and those with the 
<a href="./appendix.html#f_fov_and_pixels">most pixels</a> (\( N_{px} \)). For example in the high NA category the 
100x1.35 silicone oil objective offers the best compromise for varying sample types, with a minimum range of 10&mu;m 
for any RI. However, if the samples are mostly aqueous then the 60x1.27 water lens has a much larger range 
(truncated by the working distance at 180&mu;m). The 40x0.95 air objective is perhaps the worst option for depth, 
offering only ~6&mu;m for any liquid sample (visible on the log scale). The 100x1.45 oil may be the least attractive 
option for live biology, with the inconvenience of liquid immersion and the lowest range in watery samples (forcing 
the 3&mu;m lower bound).

In <a href="#fig_sf_and_rr_range" target="_self">Figure 4</a> we show the combined range of a widefield microscope

are limited to a particular immersion, we can (in principle) 'tune' the remote refocus optics continuously across 
the range of the sample RI (shown here). All of the configurations now benefit from the extra range provided by the RR 
optics. In particular in the high NA category the lower bound has now jumped from 3&mu;m to 35&mu;m, converting the 
100x1.45 oil lens into an attractive option for many applications. In practice this delivers deeper imaging at 
<strong>maximum NA</strong> for any sample RI under 1.45. Most apparent in the high NA category is the large increase 
in depth now available to the 40x0.95 air objective, offering deeper <strong>immersion-free</strong> imaging up to 
151&mu;m!

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>
The question of <em>which</em> objective or remote refocus optics are really optimal for a given microscope 
(or application) may be confusing to the novice, or seem dull to the seasoned microscopist. However, we clearly show
in the <a href="#results" target="_self">results section</a> that whether considering a widefield or RR setup, the 
accessible focal range depends strongly on these choices. To highlight some interesting options we target the 
discussion towards <em>watery samples</em> that are most relevant to 3D time-lapse imaging, like living cells and 
organisms.
</p>
<p>
In a widefield microscope for any sample RI under ~1.36 we can clearly see that the 60x1.27 water objective has the 
highest diffraction limited depth and the best 3D imaging performance 
(<a href="#fig_sf_range" target="_self">Figure 3</a>). In this regime the other objectives (air, silicone and oil) 
should only be considered for very shallow 3D samples (&lt 10&mu;m), or speciality situations where the lack of 
immersion, or marginal increase in NA are required (like high-speed 2D tiling or TIRF). With a 333&mu;m field of 
view, a theoretical resolving power of ~250nm and ~2600 pixels the 60x water objective is a good match for current 
sCMOS cameras and a compelling option (<a href="./appendix.html#table_highest_na">specifications from table</a>). 
We note however, that water objectives are sensitive to coverslip tilt, thickness and require regular hydration.
</p>
<p>
In a remote refocus microscope 
(<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3244420" 
title="High NA single-objective light-sheet; 
A. Millett-Sikking, K.M. Dean, R. Fiolka, A. Fardad, L. Whitehead and A.G. York; (2019)">like a SOLS system</a>)
 there are now a series of interesting options that significantly
outcompete widefield in terms of volumetric range and NA (<a href="#fig_rr_range" target="_self">Figure 4</a>).
For example we can combine an RR optimized for water with multiple objectives, like a 40x1.15 
water objective (MRD77410) for maximum depth (600&mu;m WD), a 40x0.95 air objective for 
<strong>immersion-free</strong> speed and convenience, and a 40x1.30 oil objective for <strong>maximum NA</strong>. 
Because these lenses have the same focal length they are <em>interchangeable</em> on the same system, and at 40x 
magnification offer larger fields of view (500&mu;m) and pixel counts (&gt 2927) than for example the 60x1.27 water 
objective.

We find the <strong>immersion-free</strong> configurations particularly attractive for high throughput screening 
applications

, where the benefit of robust high-speed tiling can greatly outweigh the marginal loss in numerical 
aperture. In this regime the increase in depth of a remote refocus microscope over a widefield is substantial, for 
example 151&mu;m vs 6&mu;m for the 40x0.95 air objective. On the other hand we see the coverslip 
insensitive oil immersion options with <strong>maximum NA</strong> as a great option for 3D super resolution

that benefit from the highest angular collection at the primary objective. For example the 40x1.30 oil objective from the
<a href="./appendix.html#table_most_pixels">'most pixels' category</a> can now be considered near maximum NA for 
water samples up to a diffraction limited depth of 65&mu;m, an impressive option for many samples.

Given the 'mix and match' nature of the design space and the strong dependency on sample RI, we encourage builders to 
absorb the ideas presented here, run their own calculations, and then build the best system for their application.
