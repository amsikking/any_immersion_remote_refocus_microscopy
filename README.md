A scientific publication that describes a new approach for any immersion remote refocus (AIRR) microscopy. This repository 
hosts everything you need to reproduce our results. Read the publication here:
https://amsikking.github.io/any_immersion_remote_refocus_microscopy (hosted via Alfred Millett-Sikking's personal GitHub account).

This repository is intended to hold a (mostly) self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, CSS, and small images (`index.html`, `appendix.html`, and the `javascript`, `stylesheets`, and `images` directories)
* A (limited) PDF version of the publication; note that this does not include animated/interactive figures.
* Code which produces figures (in the `figures` directory). You can run and modify this code to verify and explore our results.
