<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>
<p>
Here we present the equations used in the main article.
</p>

<h4 id="na_and_resolution">Numerical aperture and resolution</h4>
<p>
The numerical aperture (NA) is defined as:

\[ NA = n_i\sin\theta_i \tag{a1} \]

where \( n_i \) is the refractive index of the immersion medium and \( \theta_i \) is the collection half-angle of 
the objective. In the case of a planar refractive index boundary like a coverslip the NA is conserved via Snell's law:

\[ n_s\sin\theta_s = n_i\sin\theta_i \tag{a2} \]

where \( n_s \) is the refractive index of the sample and \( \theta_s \) is the collection half-angle in sample space. 
According to the Rayleigh criteria the smallest resolvable feature size \( r_{min} \) is
then:

\[ r_{min} = 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{NA} \tag{a3}\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the collected light

</p>

<h4 id="f_fov_and_pixels">Focal length, field of view and pixels</h4>
<p>
The objective lens focal length \( f \) is found with:

\[ f = \frac{f_{TL}}{M} \tag{a4}\]

where \( f_{TL} \) is the tube lens focal length (200mm for Nikon) and \( M \) is the magnification of the objective. 
The sample space field of view (FOV) is then assumed to be:

\[ FOV = \frac{FN}{M} \tag{a5}\]

where FN is the field number according to the manufacturer (20mm assumed for Nikon). When choosing an objective it 
can be useful to estimate the number of Nyquist pixels \( N_{px} \) the lens can deliver across the FOV using:

\[ N_{px} = 2 \frac{FOV}{r_{min}} \tag{a6}\]

<strong>Note:</strong> this can be useful for choosing a camera and also serves as a measure of the <em>quality</em> 
of the objective, where more pixels usually indicates a more sophisticated lens design (similar in concept to 
<em>etendue</em>).

From <a class="citation" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235927740_Effects_of_aberrating_layers_and_tube_length_on_con_focal_imaging_properties" 
title="Effects of aberrating layers and tube length on con focal imaging properties; 
C. Sheppard and C. J. Cogswell; Optik, vol 87(1), p34-38, (1991)">Sheppard 1991</a>, 
equation 18 proposes that in a medium of refractive index \( n_1 \), the maximum acceptable wavefront 
aberration (Rayleigh criterion) will not be exceeded if the thickness of a slab of dielectric \( t \) and refractive 
index \( n_2 \) meets the following condition:

\[ t \leq \frac{\lambda n_2^3}{2n_1^2(n_2^2 - n_1^2)\sin^4(\alpha/2)} \tag{a7} \]

where \( \alpha \) is the collection half-angle in the \( n_1 \) space (i.e. the immersion). Originally evaluated for 
a phase error of \( \pi/2 \), equation \( (a7) \) gives negative values for \( n_1 \gt n_2 \). If we allow 
\( n_1 \gt n_2 \) and a phase error of \( \pm \pi/2 \) then we can rewrite \( (a7) \) in a slightly more convenient 
format to give the maximum depth of standard focus \( z_{sf\_max} \):

\[ z_{sf\_max} = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin^4(\theta_i/2)} \left\lvert 
\frac{n_s^3}{n_i^2(n_s^2 - n_i^2)} \right\lvert \tag{a8} \]

<p>
From
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" 
title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; 
E.J. Botcherby, R. Juškaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson; Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">
Botcherby 2007</a>, 
equation 23 proposes that the Strehl ratio \( S \) of a remote refocus can be modeled by:

\[ S = 1 - \frac{4n^2k^2z^4(3 + 16\cos\alpha + \cos2\alpha)\sin^8(\alpha/2)}
{75f^2(3+8\cos\alpha + \cos2\alpha)} \tag{a9} \]

where \( n \) is the refractive index of the sample, \( k = 2\pi / \lambda \) is the wavenumber, \( z \) is the axial 
distance from the traditional focal plane, \( f \) is the focal length and \( \alpha \) is the collection half-angle 
of the objective. If we set \( S = 0.8 \) (the traditional diffraction limit) and rearrange we can estimate the 
maximum remote refocus depth \( z_{rr\_max} \):

\[ z_{rr\_max} = \pm \frac{1}{2\sin^2(\theta_s/2)}
\sqrt[4]{\frac{15 \lambda^2 f^2 (3+8\cos\theta_s + \cos2\theta_s)}
{\pi^2 n_s^2 (3 + 16\cos\theta_s + \cos2\theta_s)}} \tag{a10} \]

<strong>Note:</strong> the substitution \( \alpha = \theta_s \) is subtle. In
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" 
title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; 
E.J. Botcherby, R. Juškaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson; Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">
Botcherby 2007</a> at the critical substitution of equation 8 (\( \sin\theta = \rho \sin\alpha \)) the paper reads 
"In this expression \( \alpha \) is the semi-aperture acceptance angle of the lens" so one could assume 
\( \alpha = \theta_i \). However the substitution is in reference to coordinates in <em>object space</em>.
</p>

<h4 id="combined_range">Combined range</h4>
<p>
For a microscope with remote refocus optics (e.g. Figure 2) we can now estimate the maximum focus range in the sample 
\( z_{max} \) as the sum of the standard and remote ranges:

\[ z_{max} \approx z_{sf\_max} + \left\lvert z_{rr\_max} \right\lvert \tag{a11} \]

<strong>Note:</strong> the <em>approximately</em> equals sign. The standard focus and remote refocus ranges use 
different definitions for the diffraction limit, and are approximate models that ignore higher order aberrations. 
There is also no consideration given to field effects, chromatic aberrations or design and manufacturing 
imperfections that can be expected in real objective lenses.

as the angular range in the sample \( \theta_s \) decreases, the tilt of the last microscope 
\( \theta_{tilt} \) increases according to:

\[ \theta_{tilt} = 90 - \theta_s \quad (deg) \tag{a13} \]

has the most extreme tilt range of any SOLS compatible objective, with maximum 
tilt of 55 degrees. So combining \( (a1) \), \( (a2) \) and \( (a13) \) the minimum acceptable sample space NA is: 

\[ NA \geq 1.33\sin(90 - 55)= 0.76  \tag{a14} \]

<h3 id="zoom_lens">Zoom lens</h3>
<p>
In our previous RR designs we used static lenses to adjust the magnification between the sample and the remote space 
according to equation 2
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146083" 
title="Remote refocus enables class-leading spatiotemporal resolution in 4D optical microscopy; 
A. Millett-Sikking, N.H. Thayer, A. Bohnert and A.G. York; (2018)">Millett-Sikking 2018</a>, 
<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3244420" 
title="High NA single-objective light-sheet; 
A. Millett-Sikking, K.M. Dean, R. Fiolka, A. Fardad, L. Whitehead and A.G. York; (2019)">Millett-Sikking 2019</a>].
Specifically we chose to modify the second tube lens in the optical train, often referred to as 'tube lens 2' or TL2.
The TL2 location is convenient, as it leaves the first objective and tube lens pair in their traditional (stock)
configuration, and allows the addition of a unity magnification scanning system. Here we take the same approach, and 
optimize our zoom optics at the TL2 location, specifying some of the upstream and downstream optics in order to 
produce a concrete design.

<h4 id="zoom_lens_specifications">Specifications</h4>
<p>
To produce an inexpensive zoom lens with stock parts we narrow the optical requirement to a specific RR system. We
assume a standard microscope at 40x magnification since this offers many attractive primary objective options (air, 
water, silicone and oil immersion at high NA from various manufacturers). We then assume a 5mm focal length air lens 
for the second RR objective (often referred to as 'objective 2' or O2). For example the Nikon 40x0.95 air lens 
(9.5mm back focal plane diameter) is a good high NA option, with a high enough collection cone (~72deg) and pixel 
count (~2927) for most RR designs. We target a RR magnification that covers the full biological refractive index 
range (1.33-1.51) by tuning the focal length of TL2 in the range 150-132.5mm (i.e. 30-26.5x for microscope 2). 
Finally we assume a standard sCMOS field of view (~13.5mm width) and add the additional constraints of needing a 
constant track length and telecentric image.
</p>

<h4 id="zoom_lens_design">Design</h4>
<p>
Using the above specifications, we adopt a simple 'positive-negative-positive' (PNP) zoom design and cycle through 
readily available stock parts. After some iteration we settle on a series of Edmund Optics achromats that satisfy our 
optical requirements, whilst also being mechanically compatible and inexpensive (see the 
<a href="#zoom_lens_mechanics" target="_self">mechanics section</a> for parts). 
Our constraint of only using stock lenses forces a 5 achromat solution 
(<a href="#fig_optical_performance" target="_self">Figure A2</a>), where a 3 achromat custom design would suffice. We 
note that a 'standard' tube lens typically has 2 achromats, so a 3 lens solution would only add 1 achromat to the 
optical train (a minimal drawback for the system). However, we consider the small penalty on transmission efficiency 
(~1.5%) from the 2 additional achromats in the design we present to be a good trade for avoiding bespoke glass.
</p>

<h4 id="zoom_lens_performance">Performance</h4>
<p>
In <a href="#fig_zoom_spot_diagram_all_configs" target="_self">Figure A1</a> we see the spot diagrams as a function 
of field (center to edge) and configuration (min to max focal length) across the visible spectrum (450-700nm). We 
can see that the system is mostly diffraction limited throughout the matrix, with some marginal degradation at the 
edge of the field for the shorter focal lengths (higher RR magnifications). In the interactive
<a href="#fig_zoom_optical_performance" target="_self">Figure A2</a> we show detailed views of the performance at the 
extremes of the range with configurations 1 and 8 (i.e. magnifications of 1.33 and 1.51). See the zoom lens

132.5mm to 150mm in steps of 2.5mm. Spots that appear within the Airy diameter (black ring) can be considered 
diffraction limited.

<h4 id="zoom_lens_motion">Motion</h4>
<p>
Part of the design challenge in a zoom system is accommodating the motion of elements (or groups of elements). Here 
we adopt relatively large motions of 2 of the 3 lens groups from the PNP design. This has the drawback of being 
slower than small motions, but the benefit of loosening the opto-mechanical tolerances of the system, thereby 
allowing us to use stock optics and mechanics. In <a href="#fig_zoom_motion" target="_self">Figure A3</a> we see how 
we need to move the lens groups from the 'zero position' with a focal length of 132.5mm to the 'limit position' with 
a focal length of 150mm. The negative lens (center element in the design) moves the most by almost 50mm, while the 
positive group near the image move slightly less by around 42mm (the first lens group in the design is static).
</p>

<figcaption>
<strong>Figure A3: Zoom lens motion.</strong> 
This plot shows how the negative lens (central element in the PNP design) and positive group (2 achromats near the
image) should move to produce a given focal length for the zoom lens. The first lens group in the PNP design is 
static.

<p> Below we provide the 'motion functions' that convert a requested focal length to a required movement of each lens
or lens group (for driving linear stages or equivalent mechanics). Here's 
<a href="figures/zoom_lens/optics/zoom_lens_motion_example.py" target="_self">an example</a> 
for a focal length of 140mm:

<h4 id="zoom_lens_mechanics">Mechanics</h4>
<p>
Here we offer a relatively simple mechanical design 
(<a href="#fig_zoom_mechanics" target="_self">Figure A4</a>), that utilizes some fast 50mm linear stages 
from Thorlabs (DDS050). However, any mechanical solution that achieves the required alignment of the lenses and 
relative motions is acceptable. The solution we present combines the zoom optics into a single large mount that can 
(in principle) be aligned to an axis that is parallel to the optical table, and includes provision for an objective, 
a dichroic and an unhampered image plane. The DDS050 stages have a max speed of 500mm/s so we can expect a responsive
zoom experience for tuning the magnification to different sample types.

<p>
On the road to building an 'any immersion' large FOV SOLS microscope we opted to build a 'static' configuration 
(i.e. no zoom lens) to show the potential of the new approach. The system was built to accommodate primary objectives
with a 5mm effective focal length (i.e. the Nikon 40x family) with a remote refocus tuned for watery samples (i.e.
a sample RI of 1.33). The transition from air to water immersion is one of the most extreme examples of an RI 
mismatch and so the Nikon 40x0.95 air and 40x1.15 water objectives were chosen as options for the primary objective.
The last microscope (often referred to as microscope 3 in a SOLS design) was tilted to 50deg to accommodate the NA 
of both the air and water objectives. A simple cylindrical lens light-sheet excitation path was assembled, and 
combined with the following emission path optics:

<h4 id="large_fov_sols_data">Data</h4>
<p>
The Python scripts that were used to run the microscope and process the data are included in the 
<a href="figures/data" target="_self">data folder</a>. The microscope was aligned on a best effort basis, with
an overexpanded Gaussian beam for the light-sheet input (wasteful but gave uniform illumination). The light-sheet 
was generated with a 1mm slit aperture just before the cylindrical lens which was mapped onto the O2 back focal 
plane with a 1:1 relay (so about 0.66mm at the O1 BFP in this configuration). The PSF data was processed with
the same method as <a href="https://github.com/amsikking/SOLS_psf_data">here</a> (which includes sample data). To
avoid bloat the raw data (~500GB) is not included here so the publication can be readily stored and circulated 
offline.

<h4 id="large_fov_sols_improved">Improved configuration</h4>
<p>
Some attractive upgrades to the current prototype include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding the zoom lens to allow continuous tuning of the remote refocus volume to the sample refractive index 
(which we expect to keep the light-sheet in better alignment).</li>
<li>Swapping O2 from the Nikon 20x0.75 air objective to the 40x0.95 air objective. This gives improved collection 
from higher NA primary objectives, and the 40x has the correct effective focal length (5mm) to pair with the zoom 
assembly.</li>
<li>Using a high quality coverslip at O2. <a href="https://www.asiimaging.com/">ASI</a> currently offers the
Nikon 40x0.95 air objective with a high quality (AR coated) coverslip glued to the front.
<li>Adjusting the focal length of tube lens 3 for a good compromise on the Nyquist pixel size (something like a
250mm EFL).</li>
</ul>
